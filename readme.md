# About

I am currently working through the Full Stack Development Curriculum called <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> in order to pursue a career in Software Development. This repository will highlight each of the projects that I have done in this curriculum.

1. <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css">Google Landing Page</a>
<p>In order to re-familiarize myself with HTML and CSS, the google.ca page was re-created. The site is not yet completely scalable, and button functionality aren't yet implemented since I haven't gone over the JavaScript section yet. I have previously used JavaScript in previous websites, but forgot most of the syntax. To re-create the page, the element properties were inspected from the google.ca webpage using the Chrome Developer Tools. This project will be updated with better scalability and a functional search bar in the near future.</p>
